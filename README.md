# TriviaGame
Created a browser based trivia game purely from jQuery/Javascript with questions from Warcraft. I'm really proud of this one because it allowed me to use jQuery methods and techniques in ways I've never tried before. The game is simple. Start it,
answer the question within 10 seconds, it'll tell you if you're right, wrong, or if time is up. There are 10 questions and will give you your score when you are done. Click 'Reset' to try the quiz again.

Start the game:
